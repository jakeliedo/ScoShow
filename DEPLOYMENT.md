## üåê MQTT Configuration Options

### Option 1: Public MQTT Broker (Default)
- Uses `test.mosquitto.org` (free public broker)
- Works instantly without setup
- Both computers need internet connection
- No firewall configuration needed

### Option 2: Local MQTT Broker
If you want to use local network only:

1. **Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker** on one computer:
   - Download from: https://mosquitto.org/download/
   - Install and run as service

2. **Update MQTT configuration**:
   - Edit `mqtt_config.py` before building
   - Change `MQTT_BROKER` to the IP of broker computer
   - Rebuild executables

3. **Network Setup**:
   - Ensure computers are on same network
   - Open port 1883 in firewall

## üìã Usage Instructions

### Setting Up Display
1. Run `ScoShow_Client.exe` on display computer
2. Keep it running in background

### Using Remote Control
1. Run `ScoShow_Remote.exe` on control computer
2. Wait for "MQTT: Connected" (green status)
3. Wait for "Client: Online" when client connects
4. Use interface to control display:
   - **Display Control**: Open/close display, change backgrounds
   - **Ranking**: Enter and display rankings
   - **Final Results**: Show final tournament results

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "MQTT: Disconnected"
- Check internet connection (for public broker)
- Check if broker computer is running (for local broker)

### "Client: Unknown/Timeout"
- Ensure client computer is running ScoShow_Client.exe
- Check both computers use same MQTT broker

### Display not showing
- Click "üöÄ Open Display" in remote control
- Select background folder if needed
- Check if client computer has display attached

## üéØ Features

- **Real-time control** via MQTT messaging
- **Multi-monitor support** with monitor switching
- **Background management** with preview images
- **Live ranking display** with customizable positions
- **Final results screen** for tournament endings
- **Heartbeat monitoring** to check client status
- **No database required** - all data sent via MQTT

## üîê Security Notes
